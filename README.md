# first_game
A basic, single player, text-based, randomly generated, dungeon crawler type game.
The player chooses one of four starting classes, then works their way through each level of a dungeon, with the aim to reach the end.
The player interacts with the game by inputting written commands to control their character.
Each level consists of a random enemy and a chest containing either a random piece of equipment or potion.
Items can be added to the players inventory, and subsequently equipped, unequipped, discarded or used.
The players stats are determined by their starting class, their equipment, and any potions consumed during the game.
The damage done by combat is determined by the type of damage each class or enemy deals, as well as attack and defence stats.
At the end of each run, the players information is recorded in a csv file.
At the beggining of each run the high score (highest dungeon level reached) is reported to the player.
